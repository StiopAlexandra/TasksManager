# Tasks Manager

A modern Tasks Manager application built using React, TypeScript and MaterialUI to manage tasks efficiently.

## Overview

The Tasks Manager application offers a streamlined way for users to organize their tasks. It features a registration and login system, ensuring that tasks are securely linked to individual users. Upon logging in, users are directed to the Task List Page, where they can:

- View their tasks in a clean, organized layout
- Add, edit or delete tasks to keep their task list up to date
- Search tasks by title to find specific items quickly
- Sort tasks by creation date

All data is securely stored in the browser's localStorage, providing a simple yet persistent solution for data management.
